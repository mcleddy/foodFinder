## Deployed Application

## Purpose and Function
This application targets busy people who want to cook without having to run to the store to get new ingredients. This will decrease food waste, simplifies the cooking process, and introduces users to new recipes.

The user can either fillout a form of prelisted ingredients or type in their ingredients. The application will then generate six recipe cards that utilize these ingredients. The card lists the name of the recipe, the ingredients needed, and the cook time so that the user can determine what they are able to make without any unnecessary scolling or blog-reading. Once the user chooses their recipe they simply click on the link to the recipe page.  

## Languages / Frameworks Utilized
This application utilizes javascript, ajax, and CSS.
